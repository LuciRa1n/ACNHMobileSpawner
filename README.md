# ACNHMobileSpawner for MacOS/Windows 10

Multi-tool app for Animal Crossing: New Horizons built in Unity. This custom fork is designed to work better with MacOS/Windows 10 

Requires a Switch running custom firmware with the sysmodule [sys-botbase](https://github.com/olliz0r/sys-botbase) or [USB-Botbase](https://github.com/fishguy6564/USB-Botbase) installed.

It currently supports the following in-play actions:
* Injecting and deleting inventory items. Supports all players 1-8.
* Changing amount of miles, bells in your bank and in your wallet (inventory).
* [Changing and replacing villagers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5CUUZhGtsxk) using the perfect villager database.
* Changing the turnip buy/sell prices and fluctuations.
* [Creating star and item trees](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEYgo9ybB8o) using the built-in tree creator.
* [Spawning internal items*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q50R6ky0hIQ) such as the donut and harvey's fence. [A list of all internal items is here.](https://github.com/berichan/ACNHMobileSpawner/wiki/List-of-internal-items)
* Hex editing raw RAM bytes. This can be used in any Switch game, not just Animal Crossing.
* Saving, sharing and loading certain New Horizons file types: _*.nhi (inventory), *.nhv (villager) and *.nhvh (villager house)._
* Mowing your lawn (removing all weeds).

You run this at your own risk, I'm not responsible for anything. Please check the [license](https://github.com/berichan/ACNHMobileSpawner/blob/master/LICENSE) for full details before using the app or source. 

*Please do not use this app to ruin the experience of other players, **be responsible!** Do not trade or use internal items in local or online play- this should go without saying, but **they will ruin the experience of other players** as they are not easily removable on a non-cfw console.
